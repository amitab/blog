# Hello, I'm Amitabh Das

![This is an image](/img/about.jpg)

I am a Computer Science Graduate student at Arizona State University. I completed my Undergraduate in BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore in 2015, with a major in Information Science.

From the end of my Undergrad to the start of Grad School, I was working at Oracle, MySQL. Here, I got the chance to explore different areas of Computer Science. I found myself particularly interested in Storage/Database Systems and Distributed Systems. And that's why I went to pursue a Masters' Degree.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, hiking and motorbiking.
